                    Welcome to the projects nexus, the central hub for navigating to the various project threads stored
                    on this website. Each thread tells the story of another project I have had a hand in that seemed worthy
                    of mentioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most universal impulse that engineers the world over share is the desire to make things better.
                    Accordingly, work on these projects is characterized by the continual relation between this impulse and limitations
                    imposed by finite time, energy, and resources. As a result, while projects may be shelved once achieving their
                    stated goal, it is not proper to consider them completed as more improvements can always be made. By reason of
                    the same limitations, projects might go without progress for a time as priority and resources are shifted to
                    other projects.

                        Explore my adventures in building a machine capable of additive and subtractive manufacturing.
                        Motivated by a lack of tools with which to build my other designs, this project started during the COVID-19 
                        lockdowns of spring 2020. Follow along as I challenge and/or discover the reasons for various conventions 
                        in 3d-printer design.

                        These projects are an assortment of one-off experiments, typically completed in a few days.
                        Some are simply solutions to smaller problems arising from larger projects while others might
                        be cursory investigations of simple concepts that don't seem to be commonly explored in other
                        web-based resources.
