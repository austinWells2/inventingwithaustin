                <h2>Part 1 - Challenge By Choice</h2>
                <h5>Austin Wells - February 28, 2022</h5>
                
                <p>
                    During the Fall 2021 semester, I was enrolled in "Mechatronics Design", an introductory 
                    course in mechatronics engineering. As part of this course, students were given the rather 
                    nebulous task of applying what they had learned in building mechatronics systems for a 
                    final group project. Assessment would be based on three categories: interest level, presentation 
                    quality, and technical sophistication. 
                </p>

                <p>    
                    Not wanting to be outdone, one of my friends with similar hobbyist experience and I 
                    teamed up and set out with the goal of creating the most advanced project of all the 
                    students in the class. Mooted ideas included a 
                    <a href = "https://hackaday.com/2021/10/31/building-a-kinetic-sand-art-table/">kinetic sand art table</a>, 
                    autonomous egg launcher, and more but in the end, we settled on building a more traditional 6 degree-of-freedom 
                    robot arm as used in many industrial applications. The catch: we had only six weeks to design, 
                    build, and test the system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To start, we formulated a list of performance specifications and functionalities, ordered by priority. Some of 
                    the more advanced or ambitious elements of our list were identified as 'stretch' goals while the most essential 
                    were given full priority. After an initial brainstorming session, we selected solutions to some of the elements 
                    of the mechanical design and settled on using stepper motors for the primary drive. The inclusion of high-resolution 
                    encoders was planned to allow closed-loop control, but did not make it into the final design as they could not be 
                    reliably procured within the build window.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the programing side of things, we identified the need for a joint solution solver, controller firmware, and some 
                    sort of communication interface between the two. Because the mechnical deisgn was to be driven by the electrical 
                    systems which were in turn controlled by a microcontroller responding to commands sent by the operator based on the 
                    output of the solution engine, it was decided that we would work from opposite ends: one starting with dimensioned designs 
                    for the mechanical hardware and the other starting with the joit solution engine.

                    Complex robotic systems are often described as chains of interconnected links driven 
                    at joint interfaces using a Denavit-Hartenburg frame. From this model, the combined 
                    position and direction vector for the end effector can be determined based on the 
                    transformations induced by different joint angle sets, a method called forward kinematics. 
                    Conversely, the joint angle set(s) required to locate and orient the end effector can be 
                    computed with greater difficulty using a method called inverse kinematics. Inverse kinematics 
                    problems have numerical solutions for solving end locations, utilizing a jacobian inverse 
                    technique. However,
