                <h2>Part 1 - An Old Friend</h2>
                <h5>Austin Wells - January 18, 2021</h5>
                <p>
                    When I was in high school, my friend and I were restoring a broken 3d printer because of a 
                    challenge our teacher had issued. Because it was clear that we would need some sort of benchmark(s) 
                    to check between adjustments, the two of us came up with a low and high tolerance test. My high 
                    tolerance test part was a ball bearing race, which would use standard 6mm airsoft bb's for balls. 
                    After a full semester of scouring the internet and researching what makes a printer work well, we 
                    restored the printer and printed off one copy of my bearing design. After seeing just how poorly our 
                    printer was capable of performing, my hopes were not exactly high. Much to our surprise, however, the 
                    bb's snapped into the race and the bearing did in fact rotate, albeit with some persuasion. The printer, 
                    while rickety and very finicky, could be pushed to produce a sufficient surface finish for pellets to 
                    roll along the track.

                    Fast forward three years and my younger brother related that our drafting teacher had shown his Engineering 
                    III class a 'weird part, with little green balls inside of it'. He wasn't sure what it was and wanting 
                    my opinion, showed me a picture of it. To my surprise, it was indeed that same crude ball bearing I had 
                    printed off several years before and given to the teacher. I remembered how poorly it worked, but the concept 
                    still had merit and so I decided to have another go at the idea.

                <p>
                    All in one night of boredom, I continually designed and printed about half a dozen different ball bearings of 
                    various types. All of these images were taken using .20" grid paper as a background for scale. The following 
                    are the result:

                    PB01 was an experiment in the amount of clearance the races would need in order to allow the balls to roll smoothly. 
                    In the end, the races were too loose and the balls had a tendency to work their way out from between the races when 
                    the semicircular cut-outs I used to insert them were aligned.

                    PB02 was an experiment in supporting the rotating shaft with the balls directly and replacing the inner race with a 
                    spacer ring. Assembly of the bearing was exceptionally difficult as the bearing had a remarkable propensity for 
                    rapidly disassembling itself. The inner diameter of the ball clearance was almost perfectly sized to use a Pilot G2 
                    pen for a shaft. However, when I tested the bearing on this surface, I found that the ball simply slid around the pens' 
                    smooth surface. In modifying the outer race to maintain a better hold of the balls, it seemed that I had slightly undersized 
                    the race radius, resulting in the balls binding in the bearing. The idea might still have some merit, but I had already moved 
                    on by the time I found all of this out.

                    PB03 was intended to figure out how thick race walls should be in order to still allow the deformation necessary to press 
                    the balls into place. I wanted to be able to insert them one at a time and so I omitted the spacer. The races for this bearing 
                    were looser that those of PB02 but tighter than PB01, resulting in comparatively little resistance. The shallow races made 
                    balls easy to insert but also meant that applying even a little torque to a shaft could cause the balls to escape. It was a step 
                    in the right direction, not the final product.

                    PB04 was perhaps an over-reaction to the seeming fragility of my earlier designs. It was designed as a double-row angular contact 
                    bearing which would be pressed together and held with the help of six M3 screws around the races. Sturdy it was and the force produced 
                    by screws was great enough to permanently deform the outer race wall of the inner race when the balls were pressed into place. In 
                    hindsight, it is surprising that the PLA threads in the screw holes held up while the race wall was being reformed. If you look close 
                    enough at the image, you can see where this occurred. The bearing itself was seemingly indestructible but alas, the parts had lost around 
                    .005" at the top of the print, meaning that the two halves were being held together by the screws, against the balls. This was confirmed 
                    when I loosened the screws and the bearing spun more freely. Below is a clip of me spinning the bearing after loosening the screws.
