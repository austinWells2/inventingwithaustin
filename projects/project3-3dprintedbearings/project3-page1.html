            <p>
                When I was in high school, my friend and I were restoring a broken 3d printer because of a 
                challenge our teacher had issued. Because it was clear that we would need some sort of benchmark(s) 
                to check between adjustments, the two of us came up with a low and high tolerance test. My high 
                tolerance test part was a ball bearing race, which would use standard 6mm airsoft bb's for balls. 
                After a full semester of scouring the internet and researching what makes a printer work well, we 
                restored the printer and printed off one copy of my bearing design. After seeing just how poorly our 
                printer was capable of performing, my hopes were not exactly high. Much to our surprise, however, the 
                bb's snapped into the race and the bearing did in fact rotate, albeit with some persuasion. The printer, 
                while rickety and very finicky, could be pushed to produce a sufficient surface finish for pellets to 
                roll along the track.
