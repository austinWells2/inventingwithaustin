                <h2>Part 1 - An Old Friend</h2>
                <h5>Austin Wells - January 18, 2021</h5>
                <p>
                    When I was in high school, my friend and I were restoring a broken 3d printer because of a 
                    challenge our teacher had issued. Because it was clear that we would need some sort of benchmark(s) 
                    to check between adjustments, the two of us came up with a low and high tolerance test. My high 
                    tolerance test part was a ball bearing race, which would use standard 6mm airsoft bb's for balls. 
                    After a full semester of scouring the internet and researching what makes a printer work well, we 
                    restored the printer and printed off one copy of my bearing design. After seeing just how poorly our 
                    printer was capable of performing, my hopes were not exactly high. Much to our surprise, however, the 
                    bb's snapped into the race and the bearing did in fact rotate, albeit with some persuasion. The printer, 
                    while rickety and very finicky, could be pushed to produce a sufficient surface finish for pellets to 
                    roll along the track.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fast forward three years and my younger brother related that our drafting teacher had shown his Engineering 
                    III class a 'weird part, with little green balls inside of it'. He wasn't sure what it was and wanting 
                    my opinion, showed me a picture of it. To my surprise, it was indeed that same crude ball bearing I had 
                    printed off several years before and given to the teacher. I remembered how poorly it worked, but the concept 
                    still had merit and so I decided to have another go at the idea.

                <p>
                    All in one night of boredom, I continually designed and printed about half a dozen different ball bearings of 
                    various types. All of these images were taken using .20" grid paper as a background for scale. The following 
                    are the result:

                <p>
                    PB01 was an experiment in the amount of clearance the races would need in order to allow the balls to roll smoothly. 
                    In the end, the races were too loose and the balls had a tendency to work their way out from between the races when 
                    the semicircular cut-outs I used to insert them were aligned.
