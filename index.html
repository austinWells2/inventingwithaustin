                <p>
                    My dream is to inspire through invention. This website is a sort of project portfolio 
                    intended to document the development of my eclectic collection of engineering and design 
                    talents. However, I created it to be a public repository in the hopes that other ambitious 
                    inventors might somehow benefit from my work, even if only a little. I claim to be neither 
                    an field-matter expert, nor a master of engineering arts; simply someone excited to bring 
                    novel ideas to life and motivated by the prospect of a future containing untold and countless 
                    wonders.

                    Austin Wells is currently a student of mechanical engineering at North Carolina State University, 
                    where he also works as a student reactor operator at the NC State PULSTAR nuclear reactor. In addition to 
                    his studies, Austin is the current mechanical team lead of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.packbionics.com">Pack Bionics</a>, 
                    a compeditive prosthetics design club. His current research projects include procedural design 
                    of non-spherical rolling interfaces and parametric design of high-dexterity anthropomorphic manipulators.
